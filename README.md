# Logan's Feed Reader Testing Suite!
* This is a feed reader and its testing suite. I did not create the feed reader, but I implemented the majority of the testing.

## Instructions
* Download the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/loganbrick/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
* Extract the zip!
* Open the index.html file with any of your favorite widely-supported browsers.
* Note that the app does require an Internet connection!
